      <p>did you know that statistically, women apologize more often than men do? according to a <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20855900">2010 study in the US journal <i>Psychological</i> Science</a>, women report offering more apologies and committing more offenses than men.</p>
      <p>women often downplay their successes and lose confidence for the sake of "being polite". on the other hand, women that don't play by the rules are frequently called "bossy" or "conceited" where men would be called "leaders".</p>
      <p><b>empower</b> is a messaging tool that detects phrases that show a lack of confidence and suggests alternative ways to express ideas. by dropping unnecessary apologies and using clear, direct language, women will become more comfortable, confident, and proud of sharing their ideas.</p>
